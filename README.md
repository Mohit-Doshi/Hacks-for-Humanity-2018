# Hacks-for-Humanity-2018

I was part of a team of four people called "NOOBS" at the Fifth Annual Hacks for Humanity held from October 6-7, 2018 at ASU Tempe. The team designed a system which identified real-world objects from a camera or image, and converted those into descriptions which could be relayed in an auditory form to a user.

The platform for this system/service was deployed on Amazon's AWS. A Raspberry Pi was used to capture an image using a Pi-cam. I did not contibute to any of the coding efforts and instead worked on gathering data, designing graphics explaining the system, worked on the presentation, and entirely worked on the video pitch. 

The Team tied for First out of eighteen teams at the event.

NOOBS consists of myself, Sowmith Mandadi, Rahulrajan Karthikeyan, and Paige Mitchell.
